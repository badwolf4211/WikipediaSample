        Kalki Koechlin (Listeni/ˌkʌlkiˈkeɪklɒ̃/; born 10 January 1984) is an Indian actress and writer who predominantly works in Bollywood. Apart from acting in films, she is also a regular presence in theatre productions in India. Koechlin is the recipient of a National Film Award, a Filmfare Award and two Screen Awards.

Drawn to theatre at a young age, Koechlin studied drama at Goldsmiths, University of London, and worked simultaneously with a local theatre company. After returning to India, she made her screen debut in the drama Dev.D in 2009, and her performance earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. She then starred in the comedy-dramas Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011) and Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013). These were top-grossing Bollywood productions, and both earned her Best Supporting Actress nominations at the Filmfare Awards. Koechlin co-wrote the screenplay for the crime thriller That Girl in Yellow Boots (2011), in which she also played the lead role.

While she has worked mainly in independent films, including the drama Margarita with a Straw (2014), which won her the National Film Award – Special Jury Award, and the comedy drama Waiting (2015), Koechlin also appeared in commercially successful films, including the political drama Shanghai (2012) and the supernatural thriller Ek Thi Daayan (2013). She also uses YouTube as a platform or forum for issues for which she advocates, appearing in videos including AIB's It's Your Fault, Culture Machine's Printing Machine and Y-Films's web-series entitled Man's World.
